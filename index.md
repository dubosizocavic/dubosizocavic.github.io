## Projects

[My first Github project](https://github.com/dubosizocavic/dubosizocavic.github.io){:target="_blank"}  
This webpage is my first project on GitHub. I am building it as a part of my exam for the Command line course. It will present some general data about me and my progress though the course.

[Analysis of easy-to-read news in Finnish](https://github.com/dubosizocavic/dhproject){:target="_blank"}  
I am currently working on this project for my other course - Introduction to methods in digital humanities. I chose to work on the corpus of easy-to-read news in Finnish language. I will analyze some features of that language (length of words, sentences etc.), as well as look for some particular words in it (e.g. "immigrants"). I am going to compare some recommendations for that language and its actual realization. Most of the technical work will based on my skills acquired in the Command line course.
